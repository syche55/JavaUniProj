# JavaUniProj
The objective of this project is to design and implement the game of Tic Tac Toe using Java.
It is a two player game, and the rules are as follows:
  1. The game begins with an empty, 3 × 3 grid.
  2. The two players then take turns placing a mark in an empty grid cell. Player O will use the ‘O’ (letter ‘O’, not zero)        mark and Player X will use the ‘X’ mark.
  3. The game is over in either case: (i) one player has 3 marks in a sequence (vertically, horizontally, diagonally, or anti-      diagonally), or (ii) there are no empty cells left.
